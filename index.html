    <h2><p style="color: #859432;">Reptilian</p></h2>
    <p>Anthromorphic Crocodiles and Alligators who embrace raw power over intelligence and stand strong to their virtues.</p>
    <button class="fancy-btn">View Description</button>
    <div class="more-info hidden">
      <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Muddy Swamped Areas (Reptilian Kingdom), Salt Waters (???)</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Gender traits:</strong> Male: Teeth and Claws, Female: Gnaw and sharp scaled finger tips.</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> The Reptilians at the beginning of their creation were much different than you see them today. To start with the biggest change, they used to walk on four legs, can you believe that?! The species used to be as mindless as your average creature. But over time, different genes would pass through, and then out of the blue, the first sentient Reptilian: Crocayus was born. A reptile who thought beyond the common traits of eating, mate, sleep repeat, it had a brain big enough to do other things. Crocayus wanted to spread the gift of knowledge he had received too other Reptilians. Slowly as he mated with other female Reptilians, they gene of sentience passed on to multiple generations of baby Reptilians. As those Reptilians grew up, they were smarter than the previous one, and for some reason, their bones were slowly restructuring, during this weird age, Reptilians would have many structural bone problems that led to not much Evolution being made. But then they finally got out of that phase, and the species became bipedal altogether. Being Bipedal is where their species growth would really begin. They proceeded to go through 300 years of evolution, becoming smarter and building their culture altogether. While the smart aspect of them has recently stopped growing, that raw power nature they have had since their creation will forever persist with them too the end of time.</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <u>Monarchy:</u> this species culture is based around unique Reptile traits. The species treats hard manual labor like its your everyday activity, you’ll see adult Reptilians always doing work for most of their day, and days off are fair but also rare. They can choose to worship ancestors through drawing in the mud or circling around the honored ones statue on all fours. As far as greetings go, tail wraps are a common form of greeting for loved ones. Reptilians are the only species with solid visual communication. Their tail movements can mean over 20 different things alone, some common ones being one tail tap on the ground means safety, two tail taps means danger is ahead, a straightened-out tail means they’re in fear, a dragging tail means they are sad, a curled tail means they are angry, and so much more means of communication. The species gets by through utilizing their great natural physical strength to solve problems and tend to relax in swamps once the job is done via job requirement. As for the species downsides, they aren’t always the most intelligent when it comes to problem solving, often blurting out random solutions. They are also prone to unique diseases outside the average for everyone, like smallpox, adenoviral hepatitis, and other reptile-based diseases. Overall, the species thrives through building structures and ensuring almost every Reptilian has a place to work, thriving off of raw strength alone.</p>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xTGeKt9.png" alt="species image" />
    <h2><p style="color: #784C1A;">Zuku</p></h2>
    <p>Tree people who are ultimate peacekeepers and believe any conflict can be solved with words to make the world better.</p>
    <button class="fancy-btn">View Description</button>
    <div class="more-info hidden">
      <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Forest areas, almost anywhere with natural life. (Zuku Forest, Frostland Pines, Springfields.)</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Gender traits:</strong> None</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> The Zuku’s creation was one of the first amongst the other six common species, except they were just……trees. But the creators sought more out of trees than just to be used as a resource, therefore, they brought them to life years later. Zuku’s were rather simple creatures, since all they needed was sunlight and water, their heads were…..pretty empty. The dumbfounded species would just walk too where there’s sun and absorb it, then get a drink of water at the river if they needed it, that was their life for 100 years. Until one grew curious, weirdly enough, Zuku’s didn’t see bad in using natural trees as a resource, so one decided to start carving into one. After the Zuku Lady was proud of her carving, she got an idea to drag others to show them the carving. Soon enough, she had every Zuku looking at it, and this would be the great awakening for our tree species. They started to do more than just absorb sun and water; they started to innovate and evolve. As they go through such, they all ways stay true to one thing, don’t damage breathing creatures, no matter how small or insignificant. They tended to wildlife as if it was the most important task for them, even if that wildlife ripped them into little, tiny pieces. Eventually while in evolution, they discovered something immensely important to the entire continent: The Jewel of Life. This jewel-controlled life across the continent, it is also what started the monarchy system they have. So, after 200 more years of evolution, they grew into the species they are today with their peaceful culture and simple ways of life in correlation to their creation.</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <u>Monarchy transferred into Council:</u> Zuku’s culture revolves around peaceful laws and worshiping of the sun. Their traditions usually all revolve around worshiping the sun, by sticking their hands out to the side and standing in sunlight for hours upon a day, sometimes it just becomes a lifestyle for them. They also have a strong connection with wildlife around them, birds won’t fly away when approached by them, rabbits won’t run, frogs will sit on their heads, and so many more ways of connection. They don’t consume meat; therefore, no animals have a quarrel with them, allowing them to build a peaceful community around animals that they can tend too daily. The way this species progresses is through natural science, tests that cause no harm to anything important, while the tests are slow, they are safe, and it still allows them to advance, for example, they go from sleeping on the ground too having tree houses! But with this peaceful life they live also comes the troubles, Zuku’s are often clueless in a world of danger, their only sense is to run, never to fight, and that’s how its been for their entire life, this results in hundreds of Zuku’s dying each year in the hands of monsters, and they don’t do anything about it. But despite the disadvantages of peace in a world of survival, they manage their ways and make the forest extra hard to navigate with The Jewel of Life, so they can continue too life their peaceful lives for good.</p>

    <h2><p style="color: #5A0074;">Shadefolk</p></h2>
    <p>Fragile human like creatures cloaked in shadow, they are naturally weak, but they are strong in numbers and use that to their advantage.</p>
    <button class="fancy-btn">View Description</button>
    <div class="more-info hidden">
      <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Dark and Gloomy areas (The Shadefolk Kingdom)</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Gender traits:</strong> None</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> The history of Shadefolk’s is not a pleasant one. When this species was created, they were created in pain and fear. Cells in their bodies were constantly changing between gas and solid simultaneously, and because of that, they developed a huge sense of fear. The first few years of their lives were lackluster, they would just roam the land mindlessly looking for food, and fights would occur between the species over food. Because of Shadefolk’s being born a weak species, fights never lasted long, it was more of “Whoever could land the first hit” scenario. But this mindless game came to a swift end, when during a huge crowd fight, A Shadefolk screamed out while pumping his fist in the air. Everyone stooped what they were doing and directed their attention to the shouting Shadefolk. All he did was pump his fist up and down. Soon after, for some reason, everyone followed, they found peace seeing that cooperation may be an answer instead of survival of the fittest. So, everyone got to work ASAP, the species were naturally geniuses when it came to lots of things, therefore evolution escalated quickly beyond others. As they grew, the rapid cell growth and decay was cured, and they took the form of grey human shaped bodies with clear yellow eyes. While this made them stronger, they were still incredibly weak on their own, but with the cure came another blessing, the species can regenerate any parts of their bodies slowly as long as no vitals are injured and that they are properly tended too. The species was able to advance so much further than others, building marvelous and effective structures beyond comprehension almost. Not only that, but they even get too the point where they developed Carriages with horses and an effective form of the fridge to cool found and such before anyone else did, it was truly great. But they still had their fragile bodies, resulting in monsters easily picking them off, so Shadefolk were commonly encouraged to travel in groups. 250 more years of evolution pass, and they have gotten to the insane point of evolution where they are making VERY undeveloped but still working: Firearms. They take pride in their evolution and push any other species out, that is the way they wish to live their lives, in safety and prosperity.</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <u>Monarchy:</u> The Shadefolk’s culture with their constant evolution is pretty immense. They have two different major religions, one where they believe there is a single savior waiting for them in the afterlife, and the other is waiting for their ancestors and following in their footsteps. The first religion is called “Hakun” and their traditions revolve around praying each day in Chapels along with spreading the virtues of the great savior themselves. The other religion is “Ultimists” which are people who go by rules each day too be accepted by their ancestors in the afterlife, they do this by wearing feathers from 1-5 depending on their devotion. Shadefolk’s run off arguably the best economical system ever within time, developed by Necros himself, they thrive in an economy that works, but their definition of “works” doesn’t involve ensuring every Shadefolk has a job. Because of the species weak bodies, they have too covered themselves up in cloth 90% of the time being between a frozen barren and a heated desert. Because of this you may wonder how they tell themselves apart in clothing, well Shadefolk’s actually have an ability that allows them to sense another Shadefolk through a weird sense of telepathy by concentrating on the Shadefolk they are looking at, its not as long as I made the process sound, you couldn’t even tell they were trying to figure it out if you saw it in action, it just kind of happens. While Shadefolk’s are really advanced, they still have that same fear that swallowed them whole hundreds of years ago, along with already still being weak, it results in even a simply full forced punch potentially puncturing their body instead of bruising it, Shadefolk who don’t cover up properly face problems all around, with their heads slowly decaying to the pressure of temperature, some jaws may even fall off if left unmasked for a long period of time. Despite their weakness, this species stands strong in body count and they see that in what they were able to achieve so far, so they take pride in the cooperation they had developed years ago and continue to embrace their strength in their numbers.</p>

    <h2><p style="color: #D78202;">Centipedra</p></h2>
    <p>Bug/human hybrids that hail too the queen and build their lives around her, having unique traits to use too their liking.</p>
    <button class="fancy-btn">View Description</button>
    <div class="more-info hidden">
      <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Desert Areas (Centipedra Kingdom)</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Gender traits:</strong> None</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> The Centipedras creation was a spectacular one to behold. It all started with one male and one female, the male carried traits of a human while still being a bug, while the female was a bug. Their only instinct was to mate, and doing so resulted in death for both of them. But skipping that awkward part we get to the true birth of the Centipedras, half bug half human creatures born to roam the desert. At first the Centipedras didn’t have much of a purpose, they were lost without guidance, but then, a lady Centipedra emerged, one who was not like the others who were limited to regular human limbs or even an extra pair like some, the lady had 100 bug legs and a human/bug top half. She gave them guidance as it was destined that it would be the species queen. So, for a while, the bugs tended to the queens tasks, getting her food, having her spit it back up for her subjects, everything was in order, but the queen desired more than just survival, but rather evolution. So, she taught the Centipedras to do other things, like construction and everything else of such that led to advancements of all kinds. The species gained more sentience with this growth too, developing their own likes and dislikes and personalities. This is where they would build their happy and desired community, that the queen would also cherish and be proud of. For years they lived on the surface unbothered by any monsters, living a great life with a healthy sun. But good times don’t last forever, a random ambush of monsters attacked, bigger, and way higher in numbers, all the Centipedras could make out before either dying or going underground, was a lavishly dressed lizard. After the ambush, the Centipedras had no chance of returning to the surface with the number of monsters that rule over their destroyed village. So, the queen ordered them to begin anew in the Underground mines that were started. The mines became their new home, and a strong and fierce army was trained to ensure no monsters would ever threaten the underground. For the next 70 years that was their life, and they continue to rebuild and evolve their community to this day, ensuring they can have peace from monsters.</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <u>Monarchy:</u> The Centipedras culture has a lot to do with rituals. One of their biggest rituals involve dancing, as they dance for the God of fire. Other rituals have to do with rubbing the queens spit out food on their faces for good fortune. But dancing isn’t just used for rituals, it is one of the most popular activities in the kingdom. They will spend days making new dances for others to follow, almost every Centipedra enjoys dancing, especially with others since it increases the hive mind and builds bonds. While dancing is their main activity, fashion is also a really huge one. Thanks to the plentiful number of gems found in the deserts deep underground, it’s not hard to get your hands a nice-looking piece of jewelry. Another way to look well fashioned is to cover yourself in blue beetle essence, a light blue spray that comes out of beetles that acts similar to tattoos, this also shows that you either respect the army or are an army member yourself. Centipedras also have the ability to drill underground, their bodies are filled with limbs that can twist extremely fast on command, and their hands become stronger than even some metals at this time. They drill the fastest in deserts but can also drill through dirt. While Centipedras seem like an ideally perfect species, their mating seasons are very distorted, which often results in unwanted overpopulation and a lot of children being orphaned. But despite the hardships they go through, they still push on to live their thrilling lives and to serve the queen with pride.</p>

    <h2><p style="color: #DB59BA;">Crystal</p></h2>
    <p>Colorful rock monsters that represent forms of sea life, they believe everyone should be as free as possible to make everyone they can happy.</p>
    <button class="fancy-btn">View Description</button>
    <div class="more-info hidden">
      <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> The Crystal Area and its Underground (Crystal Kingdom), The Ocean.</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Gender traits:</strong> Male: No eye patterns, Female: Eye patterns around their whole eyes.</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> The Crystals history is a short one compared to all the other species. A Crystal heart of immense size laid dormant in the ocean, there it sat for hundreds of years. But then finally, when the sun shone in the right spot, the heart woke up. Immediately after its awakening it started generating terrain at an insanely fast rate, covering up the part of the land that seemed missing from the continent in beautiful and luxurious crystals. After the land was finally complete, the heart then started glowing again, and then, it started giving birth. It gave birth to only one Crystal to start; they were already fully grown. The Crystal looked around in confusion but then found itself at ease when looking at the heart. As the Crystal creature communicated with the heart, it learned so many things, like their purpose. The Crystal deemed their name to be Ukara, the only Crystal without a gender. The Crystals that came to birth right after were only babies, and it was Ukara’s duty to raise them with freedom. And so, they did, they raised each crystal, male and female alike, to be the strongest versions of themselves. As Ukara would guide a generation of Crystals into adulthood, more would be born by the Crystals heart, and Ukara would raise those next. Soon enough, they became a large community of creatures, free from restraints of laws, allowing them to find their passions freely. Everyone cherished and loved Ukara, they saw them as a leader, but Ukara didn’t like the idea of being called that, they saw themselves equal amongst all crystals. Together, the community of Crystals built their community on the terrain created for them, while most of it was underground in the ocean depths level, they also dwelled on the surface a bit. For over 150 years, this cycle would repeat, the community would grow healthily, and the Crystals couldn’t see a better life for themselves without Ukara, they have given everyone a sense of purpose.</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <u>No Government:</u> The Crystals culture is probably the biggest out of all the species. The number of different activities and traits these species have is truly endless. Some popular ones are spending time in the ocean, worshiping the sea life off in the distance and giving them gifts, Ukara never told them why, but it has become a loved tradition since the sea folk would repay them with kindness, a bond to never be broken. Another popular one is the gladiators ring, where crystals can fight in all out combat to see who is the strongest of them all! Or they can spend their time, worshiping the crystal heart and thanking it for all it has given them, some give offerings to the crystal heart as well, which the crystal heart lets the giver know they are appreciated. Discovery is another popular topic, testing limits of different crystal bodies through dangerous activities. Then there is also an entertainment category where crystals make music for others to enjoy, a truly popular activity and perfect for starting crowd fights. Crystals have all sorts of unique abilities based on the sea creature they are. Predator based Crystals often have higher combat abilities and heighten sense and speed. Or there is also Tame based Crystals which emphasize their ability to get along with others well and make friends with ease. While the Crystals seem so free and happy, having no government brings its own issues. Without a government, the Crystals often suffer from high crime rates and casualties across the species, which puts a significant toll on their ability of freedom. But most learn to respect the rules, and they believe if everyone does their part, that they can’t possibly fail as a society, they hope too live their lives with nothing to stop them!</p>

    <h2><p style="color: #68D4D9;">Frost</p></h2>
    <p>Blue colored humans that take a similar road as regular human evolution, going through their own hardships and successes in the snow.</p>
    <button class="fancy-btn">View Description</button>
    <div class="more-info hidden">
      <p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Iceland’s (Frost Kingdom)</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Gender traits:</strong> None</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> The Frosts history begins similar to humans, two Frosts born, they mate, and the species evolves. But as time carried on since the beginning the species, the environment got colder, and it forced them into instant innovation. The species together had to find a way to survive the drastic cold weather they were born in. They were like caveman, except just a bit smarter, as they learned how to make fire, the species huddled around it, finding that it was nice and warm. But then they realized they didn’t like that nice and warm, some of the Frosts collapsed after standing to close to the fire for a long period of time which set them back. But that didn’t stop them, they learned to find the perfect temperature, hunted snow animals and went on to survive well. After many years passed and their community grew big enough, they decided to settle in the Icy area, as they eventually grew resistant to the weather and adapted better to extreme heat as well. They built many Igloos, and they saw it as a perfect way of survival. In fact, it was so perfect that they wanted to improve it further. The entire species gained a sense of agricultural and drive to do construction to then make amazing structures together. Some structures were made for simple beauty, while others completed a task that made their lives easier. They went on too then evolve even further, since they were also a very gifted smart set of species. Together thanks too every Frosts contribution, they built an amazing community that gave off waves of warmth in a barren wasteland. They were able to reshape a land so useless and uninhabitable and make it into something great, something all of them were proud of. For the next 260 years, they would be one of the most reinforced and civilized kingdoms ever, having a ginormous castle where the council sits and an amazing string of beautiful buildings sitting right below it. Kids laughed, adults cheered, the Frosts have made it, despite the horrid cold and the intense heat that would’ve seemingly killed off their species, they made it, and that is something all Frosts think about as they go to do their next great thing.</p>
</br>
      <p><strong>Culture:</strong> <u>Council:</u> The Frosts have an amazing culture built around the things that they build. While building itself is all something that they take too heart, they have enforced the rather appealing looks of building into a hobby, making sculptures, big or small is an activity all frosts can enjoy to do and something that children are often given to do during their educational journey. Some Frosts then use the sculptures they make and pray too them for their own different reasons. Another major activity they delve into is sports, while building, an inventor named Henry makes the discovery of animals skin being used for something else other than clothing and warmth, he then would go to make a ball, one that could be kicked a great distance, and thus soccer was born. Alongside soccer came hockey, and together the sports would be embraced in harmony as they enjoy the sports and their rules together along with continuing to making new sports. Another activity Frosts embrace is survivability tests. They will constantly put themselves out on the stormy frontier of their lands too see how long they can live out there before packing up and going home, it’s an extreme activity that many adult Frosts have come to enjoy. Frosts can grow to be strong and smart, but what brings them down the most is extreme heat, while it may not kill them anymore by just being near it, it will most definitely make them weak, causing them to fall ill in some cases as well. But they never sought that too be a problem that they couldn’t fix and continue to advance and promote their building desires, to make a strong and safe nation for all Frosts too live in.</p>
