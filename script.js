    bio: ' Crizion is an optimistic Reptilian who always looks on the bright side of things. He will never hesitate to help out friends or family in need. Crizion was born a few days after The Dark Skies War was declared. When his village was under siege, his father, who was an excellent warrior, goes to defend his hometown, after defending it greatly for some time, he eventually met his end as an arrow was struck through his head. As the warriors of the Shadefolk kingdom pushed closer, their home was burnt to the ground with Crizion and his mother in it, while his mother died under the collapse, Crizion lived, who was then quickly saved by an Anonymous Reptilian Warrior and brought to shelter until the war passed. From there, his grandma Pho took Crizion under her wing. Eventually, Crizion had to get a job as a blacksmith to support his grandma who was unable to work after finally retiring from her job. Crizion actually learned to like this job, there was something about sharpening weapons that he couldn’t shake. Crizion makes sure to work hard to make currency by day, and train to be a great warrior at night. He spends every night since his 13th birthday, when he was gifted with a spear, to train with it in every way possible so he can be prepared for anything, he REALLY loved to sharpen it. At age 16, Crizion was heading to work when all of a sudden he wasn’t looking and walked right in front of a royal carriage, causing Crizion to fall to the ground. The prince of the Reptilian Kingdom exited the carriage and started to cuss Crizion out. But Crizion didn’t know what to do, he didn’t know what to say, he’s never stood up to anyone like this before. The prince was fed up with his actions that Crizion didn’t mean to commit and grabbed a whip out of the carriage. Crizions eyes widened as he started to back up on all fours. The prince utter to himself before readying the whip: “This is what happens to Reptilians who don’t fall in line.” And right after, he launched the whip. In that moment, something snapped in Crizion, he gained lightning-fast instinct out of pure rage from that one sentence. He immediately uses this instinct to catch the whip around his hand and throw the royal to the ground. The royal ended up crying and said a mumble of words along the lines of revenge and left. In current day after the events, nothing was done about it and Crizion continued to work at the blacksmiths happily while spending time with his grandma. Crizions dream is to explore the world and make new friends, and to find that spark to make the world a better place!'

    bio: 'Crazytree (also known by Fern) is a clueless Zuku that never knows what’s going on. Once he is fixated on something, he will stop paying attention to anything else, but he is also loyal to the very end when it comes to friendships. Crazytree was born about a year before the Dark Skies wars beginning, as he grew up, He was an insane kid that didn’t think too much about his choices, he did what he pleased. So instead of calling him by his real name Fern, everyone nicknamed him Crazytree. His father, who was the King of the Kingdom, had a pent-up rage from Crazytree’s actions as they got worse. Soon he couldn’t take it anymore, since lecturing had no effect, he struck Crazytree. After being struck, Crazytree was put in a state of mind where he did nothing, people thought he was paralyzed and mentally damaged and the King regretted his action the most. Crazytree continued to sit in this state of mind for years to come. It raised concern about the kings royalty position in a kingdom of peace. But in reality, during this dormant time, Crazytree was happy, because he was able to talk with his mother that passed during his birth. Crazytree didn’t know if it was real or not, but he made sure to enjoy every moment of it while he could. Even more time passed and eventually The Dark Skies war came, the Zuku\'s entire kingdom was up in flames, The King quickly grabbed Crazytree from his seated spot and ran to a secret safety chamber while Arrowite fended off Shadefolk soldiers. The chamber could only hold one person, but was immune to almost anything, it was reserved for the king. But instead, The King shoved Crazytree in there along with the powerful gem from his staff, the chamber was sealed off and the king went up in flames. After a long slumber that caused him to become mute in the process, he was released by no other than Crizion himself, to which he gave his utmost loyalty to Crizion. Crazytree try’s his best to tend to peaceful tactics, but knows that violence must sometimes be an option with the great power he has. His dream is to restore peace to the world with his buddy Crizion.'

Yaozen got what he wanted instantly as the eldest brother Wuji was gifted , so Reiss and Garvoch were cast aside and paid no attention too. The dark skies war took place, but Bulletblade was safe inside the castle with the strongest defense, so he went unaffected. As time passed from there, he took on the job of a guard. One day, he chased a thief into a valley who had stolen fruits, once he reached the end of the valley is where everything changed for him. He saw hundreds of Shadefolk, starving and with ripped clothes. That was all Reiss needed to see to realize how cruel his father’s methods were. That same day, he confronted his father about it, and they ended up getting into a huge argument, something Reiss said to Yaozen really struck Yaozen’s ego, so Yaozen swung his claymore and Reiss and banished him from the Royal doors. From there, Reiss traveled back to the Valley with the unfortunate in it and offered help, their chief accepted them. From there, Reiss became an astonishing thief, honing his skills to perfection to steal all kinds of necessities without anyone batting an eye. Eventually he was caught on too though and a bounty was put on his head. But that didn’t stop him, the chief of the unfortunate gifted Reiss with fancy cloth that resembled a ninja suit and two katanas, shortly after, Benton gifted him with two pistols crafted by him for helping his family in the unfortunate. Reiss then decided to go by the nickname Bulletblade, and he swore to fight for the unfortunate, since that’s what he wants to do. Bulletblades dream is to correct the mistakes his father made...and to pick up a hot chick to marry along the way.'

Anya ended that conversation with a slammed door. She made her way to the frontline winter storms of the Frosts land and set up her own bootcamp. This is where she would spend the next 2 years.

  bio: 'Arrowite is a fearless highly trained Zuku archer who devotes his life to protecting Zuku royalties. He never takes anything lightly, and he will not fail any task given to him unless it costs him his life. Arrowite started out his life outside the Zuku Forest, he was born a pine variation somewhere near the frosts kingdom, where a small village full of pine variation Zukus sat. That village did not last long after his birth, 4 years after he was born, the village was ambushed by a huge snow beast. The beast chewed every pine Zuku to bits seemingly, not a piece of bark to be spared. When the ambush ended, there was not even half of what the population was left. About a week after the ambush, Igor arrived at the village. After hearing of the disasters, Igors first instinct was to offer training to all the survivors, most of them accepted. Arrowite trained with whatever pine Zuku peers were left under Igor. Fast forward 12 years of brutal survival, and Arrowite has mastered bow combat by choice. He was easily the most skilled and adapted one out of them all and never hesitated to Igors commands. It was then at that moment that Igor Decided to make Arrowite his disciple, and Arrowite happily accepted. As they traveled back to Zuku Forest together, they built a great bond, Arrowite was happy to be around Igor and to learn from him as much as he was proud to have found a wise master. For the next 2 years, they attempted to start a training program but were only able to get so many that accepted the harsh truth of violence over peace. The Dark Skies War hit, and Igor immediately ordered Arrowite to protect The King, this would be the only time he would hesitate, as he worried for his masters safety, with another harsh yell from Igor, Arrowite was off, and that would be the last time he saw Igor. After the war passed, he lay in a bunker underground, protecting whoever was left after the devastating blow on the Zuku Forest. Arrowites dream is to make up for failing to protect the king and to find his master once more.'

She always is thinking about something, and she will never give anything a second thought, and it makes it worse with her genetic body. Larah was born in a regular household with her sister Jyaine, Larah was the older sister, and together, they were the best of friends who almost always got along. They had a happy family together; it seemed like nothing could go wrong. But when Larah was 11 years old, something terrible happened, she developed a horrific disease. The unknown disease caused her to lose hair and sap; she was dying all too quickly. When she rushed to the emergency room, they tried every medication they had. Over the past few days, nothing worked. But then, a crazy scientist named Tranel provided a solution. It was not full proof, but the parents wanted to do whatever they could, since she’d be dead in a matter of hours. Tranel explained it was a growth serum that would make up for her miss sap and hair, and that the side effects were unknown. Once she was green lit, Tranel injected the serum into Larah. In a matter of days, Larah was feeling better! It seemed as if the serum was a success, but the growth serum was just beginning. A few eeks after that, she started to hear voices, grow bigger overall, and grow + shed grass hair like crazy. It wasn’t long before Larah started to hear voices, like screams of her loved ones, being put through eternal pain. On one random night, all hell set loose with her, she seemed like a giant mutant, almost unrecognizable to be a Zuku. She went around destroying whatever she saw, she just couldn’t control her emotions, she didn’t know what to think. After wearing herself out from the tantrum, the Zukus captured her and put her in a deep underground cell made of the hardest wood and earth, and Larahs family had no chance to be able to see her again, as she was hidden in a top-secret place. Larah sat in that prison, slowly breaking the wood while going through nightmares at the same time. She went right through The Dark Skies War at 13 without even knowing it happened. After 12 years, she finally broke free from her prison. She traveled to the surface just to see everyone was gone, and the forest was overgrown. While some moments were calm for her, she still had her outbursts in the forest for the next couple of years, smashing whatever she sees for long periods of time. Larahs dream is uncertain, but somewhere deep inside, she wants someone to help her the most.'

  bio: 'Chioka is a fierce and uncanny Zuku that goes against every pacifist belief the Zuku’s have. Her desire is to convert everyone to be a more aggressive society so they can defend their nation, but instead of waiting for progress, she uses unnecessary force and teachings, she is a brute, and she knows it. Chioka’s story begins when she was a little girl in a happy family. She believed too once that pacifism was the way of ultimate living. She and her family would go out every day, supplying resources to the poor and praying at statues of the ultimate prophets of nature. She enjoyed this activity deeply, she thought anything was possible for her future, that she could too be one of those prophets. But those dreams all came to rest a one horrible day. She was 15 years old, Chioka and her family decided to adventure outside the Zuku Forest one day to have a picnic, everything around her was beautiful, she thought nothing could go wrong…..until she peered into the distance. A monster stared at them from afar, drooling with utmost hunger. Chioka was frozen in place, and when her family also realized it, they ran for their lives, Chioka did as well. During the chaos, she got separated from her entire family. About 5 minutes later, she goes looking for them……only to see them brutally torn apart by the monster. Chiokas dreams were shattered at that moment and realized every moment in life is a fleeting one, that death can happen at any moment. She wanted to do everything to prevent that. So, after mourning and praying for her family, she rushes back to Zuku village and screams at everyone about the attack, desperately trying to grab someone’s attention. At that they did, they reacted to this, but not in the manner Chioka thought. Chioka’s whole idea of safety and defense changed, she was hoping to get Zuku’s to use weapons to fend off or kill the monster, but instead, they went and hid. Chioka was asked so many questions in the bunker, but none of them mattered to her, only one thing was on her mind, and she spoke it loudly: “WHY ARENT WE KILLING THIS THING?!”. The Zuku’s went silent, gave her a disappointing look, and ignored her the rest of the time. While Chioka felt defeated that her opinion wasn’t understood, she instead was going to take action. After hearing about Igor and his defense progress, she joined it at 16, and for the next 3 years she was taught under Igor, until Igor realized she wanted more then slow progress and defense, she desired killing all monsters and forcing everyone under the propaganda. Igor ended up banning her from the dojo, but she scoffed at him and left. 3 years pass as she hones her skills and kills many monsters and The Dark Skies War hits, she watches as the entire nation goes through the worst, instead of helping any potential Zuku she came by, she watched. She watched all while saying, “I knew it.” In her head. After the War, she decided to go on a journey of her own that improves her strength even further. Then during parts of her journey, she would travel to the remaining living Zuku who still had the virtues of pacifism and teach them a lesson. Across 18 years, these lessons went from speeches, too actions, actions that almost hurt Zukus, but only haven’t because of Arrowite, her patience waivers quickly, and nobody may stop her if it does. Her dream is to drag every Zuku into the virtues of violence, not anymore to just defend themselves, but to make every other nation fear the Zuku’s for good.'

The first few years of his life he grew up regularly, The Dark Skies War flew right over his head since they were well protected and in control. He first dreamed about being an elite soldier to serve the Shadefolk kingdom.

But each day they did, Garvoch would look out the window and notice the workers condition. Each day, Garvoch saw something worse and worse come to rise. What first started as a minimum number of casualties in labor and training has quickly risen with Yaozen’s demands, overall leading to more injury and death amongst the Shadefolk people. One day after seeing more than a quarter of labor workers die or be put out of commission, Garvoch snapped at his father, telling him how this is all so cruel.

So, at age 15 he was kicked out of his home and school after an incident involving throwing someone through a brick wall. Carpacho would then look back at this moment often, but instead of thinking about what he did wrong, he thought about how strong he could become. He spent the next 5 years of his life making himself stronger. He took heavy doses of supplements that drastically increased his size overall, he can barely fit through doors. No other Shadefolk could’ve handled all of that, but he did, it even made his face more resistant to harsh weather, meaning he doesn’t need a mask as much as all the other Shadefolk’s. He was 20 when the dark skies war hit, and being on the poor side of the Shadefolk kingdom, they had barely any line of defense, so Centipedras, Reptilians, and Frosts took this opportunity to infiltrate out of rage of losing their people. But Carpacho was ready. Before the war, he buddied up with one of the engineers from Necros’s crew, their friendship slowly turned into a forced one. The engineer forcibly made a special new weapon never seen before (a machine gun) just for Carpacho, since he could solely handle the size and weight. Now as he enters the battlefield with a big grin on his face, he mowed down just about everyone that came his way. Since the weapon was so powerful, it even penetrated Reptilian scales. He easily shredded through all the species there as they fled in fear. The entire town was grateful for saving so many lives, some even gave him gifts. This is when Carpachos business would begin. For the rest of his life up to today, he charges people for their protection and has built a gang for the entire operation. The business was super successful, since the poor couldn’t afford proper protection, Carpachos was, well, cheaper than there’s. But if you don’t give him his money when he wants it, then its lights out for that person, that is exactly what made him feared, but no one could stop him.

There she learned the ways of being a lady, back when she was born, ladies were taught to be housewives for men that defend the kingdom. This teaching almost drove Yavel too insanity, it is not what she want to do at all. Every time she got an idea to go pursue her own dreams, they were shot down by higher up females.

It wasn’t long before he was solving Calculus problems at 7 and doing Physics by the age of 12, he was a remarkable genius. It was all anyone would ever talk about for a few years.

Horns grew out of his head, wings on his back, a tail of a hog, the tongue of a snake, the eyes of a twister, and finally, the occasional vocal cords of a chicken. The scientists finally reentered the room after the transformation. The scientists asked Necros if he was ok, and he only said one thing “I feel…..happy.” followed by a maniacal laughter and a chicken cluck. It wasn’t long before the scientist discovered he wasn’t smart anymore, and sadly, they had to put him in an insane asylum for some of the crude actions he committed after his transformation. For 20 years he sat in the asylum, but he didn’t mind because he was properly fed and was happy with his own thoughts. He didn’t even know The Dark Skies War happened. It wasn’t until later that the king offered him the chance to work under royalty, and everyone around them was confused. Necros nodded heavily in agreement.

  bio: 'Heveres is a fierce but ultimately loyal soldier in the Centipedra Kingdom. He is usually quiet and nonchalant but will always stand up for a female in clear danger no matter what.  Growing up in a household of sisters and a single mother, he witnessed and learned the ways of how the females benefited society and wanted to protect it. His mother grew more and more proud of him each day, as Heveres continued to respect his sisters work more and more and that he was able to get along with them really well. The Dark Skies War really proved this, as when they were all in shelter, Heveres would give them his food to eat. Heveres grew to be a fine male Centipedra, building up his body to his full potential and entering the army. There was a brief moment when everyone started to fear him, for it reminded them of a horrid male centipedra that caused chaos a long time ago. But after seeing Heveres kindness and compassion, they all quickly shook off the thought. As Heveres started to climb the ranks, all the female Centipedras loved him. He was asked multiple times to be a husband to many of them but declined because he believed he would interfere with their life, and maybe a touch of fear within himself too. But that didn’t stop them from liking him, he was very friendly and always found time to give his sisters and mother gifts. But one day, he lucked out while in the battlefield. A small war between the Shadefolk and Centipedras was brewing for territory and while Heveres took down more foes than anyone, they slit his throat slightly. Rushed immediately to the ER, he was going to recover fine, but his throat vitals were damaged, making his voice all fuzzy and grouchy and that it also hurt him to talk. After being fully recovered, Heveres was awarded the act of bravery by the queen of the Centipedras, an award that no male had received for a long time. Everyone was happy for his success, and Heveres couldn’t be happier seeing his mom smile for him. After that, Heveres was awarded a direct position to guard the queen, one of the highest positions in the army, and that’s where he stands tall and proud. Heveres dream is to continue to pursue his kindness towards female Centipedras and to never let it waiver.'

  bio: 'Lisa is a renowned sharpshooting Centipedra that never wastes a shot with her hunters rifle. She is hearty and likes to keep herself busy but also has a habit of whacking people with a stick. Her story begins when the Centipedras were still above ground. Back when times were desperate to quench thirst. She was only taught to do one thing ever since she was able to understand things, and that was to hunt. Each day she would either be honing her skills of hunting or putting them to the test against the upcoming threats of monsters. If you think she ever did anything else with her life until she was an adult, you’d be wrong, literally every day was hunting day to survive in the desert. She was taught the whole reason that they remained in the desert was for that plentiful amount of food supplies and that they are able to drill themselves underground using their bodies in sand only. Lisa never found time to relax, while she did enjoy hunting a lot, she felt as if she was missing out on her own life, that there was something more. So, when she was 22, she went out to go find that reason to live. She wandered the desert aimlessly, hoping she’d find something new and exciting, and boy did she get more than what she bargained for. The first few years, nothing special happened, but she noticed each year, the monster population was rising. It wasn’t until she was 42 that the real action happened, with only herself and her bow (rifles weren’t invented yet), she would fight hordes of rushing monsters in the direction of her hometown. She was very close to death one time as a monster snuck up behind her, but using the skills she had learned over the years, she handled it very well, she only lost an eye in the process! Her entire journey taught her that there was so much more to hunting and that she learned so many survival skills just by going off alone, the only thing she could’ve wished for was some company…. She returned to the hometown 3 years later to see that they had also grown, and that everyone seemed to have also developed hunting skills. But no one seemed to care for her return, she learned that her mother died during a monster attack, and her father fell into a quicksand trap, both parents lost to the cause of inexperience. She moved on passed this; she learned that no time is a good time to sulk. After The Dark Skies War passed, the development of the Shadefolk’s revolutionary firearms began in every kingdom. Lisa wished to qualify to test the weapons, and she did not disappoint anyone, she learned really quickly how the design of the rifle worked and studied for years to come. It wasn’t long before she was a well-known hunter across the board, and through all the fame, she somehow adopted a kid that adored her, Izzy. She is grateful for her kindness every day, as she feels it filled that hole she was missing when she was alone. Now in the current day, Lisa is teaching young Centipedras the way of the rifle and raising Izzy to be a fine woman like her. Lisa\'s real dream though, is to see Izzy become successful and make friends someday, and she had a feeling it would come true soon.'

  bio: 'Zeeneth is a smooth and sassy kind of centipedra who loves all things that shine. She’s a huge lover of the community, and as every year went on she only grew to love it more and more. Her main role within the colony is as a traditional Centipedra dancer, often seen taking part in dancing for large events and celebrations. She was born in an extremely fashion-oriented family so when there isn’t anything going on, she’s often at home making clothes and jewelry for her friends and siblings. Even though the Dark Skies war was going on and she was only 4 years old, she helped her family maintain a semblance of peace and harmony amongst the people of the colony by making them jewelry and other things. Sometimes she gets embarrassed when the older Centipedras remind her of her old works from then, since she strongly believes that the things she made were an “embarrassment to her craft” even though she was only 4. She’s a very headstrong girl with a strong sense of determination and works  extremely hard to achieve her goals and dreams (even though they can change with a flip of a coin sometimes). Because of how sassy she can be and the way her mannerisms are, Zeeneth can sometimes come off as a bit catty or mean, but she just struggles with social cues sometimes and ends up getting pretty nervous when she wants to try and make a new friend. When she isn’t all nervous or slipping up, she’s actually pretty bubbly and a big sweetheart. Zeeneth, despite her visually lean appearance, is actually quite strong! Especially in her legs, her being a dancer being a result of that aside from her own personal training. She’s quite agile and a very fast runner and a majority of her main combat skill revolves around kickboxing. At first, she didn’t care about being “strong” or anything of the sort. She believed that her main purpose was to be a fashion designer, and that was it. But one day, she was roaming amongst the colony to bring a gift home for her younger sibling who made her first golden bracelet all by herself, she saw the warriors return home after the small war they had between the Shadefolk. She, of course, joined the rest of the other Centipedras who cheered and congratulated them on making it back alive, profusely thanking them for their efforts … but when Zeeneth looked each one in the eye, her mind started to wander. Perhaps one day, she could be a warrior herself. As crazy as it sounded, Zeeneth had always been somewhat obsessed with being a hero to her people in other ways than making clothes or jewelry, or dancing to the beat of a drum. After becoming an elder sister to two and her parents getting older and much less capable, she’s felt this undeniable urge to become a protector of those she loves most and what better way to do that than join the warriors in their battle! Ever since that day, she’s spent most of her days training her physical combat ability, honing her agility and endurance, even though she’s been put down into the dirt and discouraged by her older siblings who don’t take her seriously at all. Zeeneth had a history of having these huge, drastic dreams that she’d forget about in a week, but Zeeneth felt this calling in her heart. Her new and undeniable dream is to prove to her naysayers that she will be strong enough one day to fight alongside the elites like Ugarness, and that she wasn’t just another face in the crowd with unrealistic ambitions.'

He enjoys nothing more then flirting with adult women, and having the best time with them possible, making sure the fun times they have is filling his pockets. His story began with a regular family, it was his mother, his father, and him. His mother though was not a very good person; she drank the nights away and often came home a wreck and even abused Decratos some nights as a kid. His father on the other hand was the best man he could be a fine businessman who ran a small weapons shop into a fashion shop for Centipedras. Decratos’s father put up with his wife to see if he could change her, to make her realize her mistakes, but that progression never happened. Decratos never really had any input at this time, but he enjoyed when his father would take them out for treats, one of the only good times he had. During The Dark Skies War, it didn’t help that each night felt like one of terror, worrying about death, but his father kept him comfort. One day, when Decratos was 13, his mother tried to kill him for not giving her what she wanted, and that’s where his father drew the line. A Divorce happened, but it was already too late, Decratos was scarred for life, he saw nothing good in his mother and that behavior rubbed off on other females he met, he would often flinch at the sight of them and give them nasty looks. His father didn’t like this newfound behavior, Decratos didn’t care, and left his father’s side at 16. Decratos learned something very important as he started to reach adulthood. In a society where females ruled supreme, males could very easily overtake them. He improved his physique so much, and since he was born with the rare 4 arm trait that his father also had, it made him even more powerful. But Decratos knew he couldn’t just go against the whole society, it wouldn’t work. Then he had a bright Idea that would change there society forever. A club, one where adult Centipedras can have a fun time and not have to worry about anything. A place where pleasure was gifted with open arms, no matter what you liked. For the next few years, Decratos had A LOT of action, he himself was starting to become an attraction for women. Decratos learned many things from his “experiences” with females, that they have a weak spot for males in terms of lust. Decratos took full advantage of that, and made his business thrive. Now Decratos’s club is one of the biggest hit places in today’s Centipedra society, and it wasn’t dying down anytime soon, not while Decratos was still planning for his ideal kingdom. Decratos’s dream is to emphasize male strength to others and to live in a kingdom where males could rule the day, and make his father see the benefits.'

She was the oldest of them all. Ugarness took immediate interest in fashion, she was obsessed with dresses and jewelry like nobody else. While she had these hobbies, each day of her life she would have to deal with her annoying brothers. It wasn’t sibling bias either, the brothers were really bad. They shaved pieces of Ugarness and her sisters hair as a prank, and it was just a prank bro. But as they all grew up together, Ugarness would see those moments that really matter, being a part of family, and cherishing those moments, she made various attempts to get along with their brothers, and 50% of the time it worked. She spent the next few years enjoying her hobby of dress collecting and such, but her brothers were still up to no good. In fact, it only got worse for them. One of the brothers joined a gang, where status was everything. It caused him to scream at his parents for not letting him stay here anymore since he developed many bad habits, soon after his depart, he was stabbed to death. As for the other brother, he started off on a bad path too, which Ugarness saw and made her realize how flawed males can be, she didn’t even care about what her other brother went on to be. Ugarness then decided to join the army, to be with the female segment and not have to worry about the males. During this time, she also had an outstanding growth spurt, sprouting to be the tallest Centipedra yet. Not only her height grew, but also her heart, as she was a shoulder to cry on for many females and put dozens of men’s heads in trashcans during the process. She was an Icon to all women around her, lots of women wanted to be like her, it made her happy to see that people were looking up to her. She also realized that males were looking up to her too, and thought, maybe there could be a change of heart. Today, she serves a top position in the army as Captain and ensures no female is left behind and that they are all happy. Ugarness’s dream is to demonstrate female strength to everyone and maybe try to find out what she could be missing about males.'

Girades’ story begins with an unknown story; he was born in Revendead and somehow made his way to Fraier. He gained consciousness then and already, his life was under immediate threat, a monster attack! He flees the scene as quick as he could. Girade quickly learns the dangers of life itself, and he just had woken up. This would set the tone for most of Girades’ life, as he grew in size, so did monsters. There was nothing Girade could do against them, he felt powerless. Any time in his lifespan that he would try to fight back, he ended up almost killing himself. With the constant pressure in fear, he almost couldn’t take it and thought about ending his life. He thought about how no one was there for him for years and that he would never make a single friend in this life. But before he could do so, he started to ponder, to ponder about his feats. He thought about how he has outrun every single monster he’s ever come across. Then at that moment, he realized its not just size and strength that contribute to the food chain, that he himself could be a predator. He immediately put this to the test with the upcoming rise of monsters in the desert. He used his speed and stamina too toy with the giant monster, and it worked, after it was tired out, Girade would run on the monster and take bites for himself where the monsters could not reach him, and he chowed in until they were dead. The continues to be a trend, he realized that he can be top of the food chain. But then Girade thought; “Why should I stop their?”. Instead of continuously being no better than the mindless monsters, he started to make them bow to his service after tiring them out and learned their ways of submission. It wasn’t long before Girade had a monster army of his own, ones that were barley sentient but still. Girade forced them to build an empire of his own on the surface and to expand his reign across the desert. He noticed the Centipedras on the surface, one of the species that also tried to kill him, so he returned the favor, and mercilessly sent monsters to their village to force them underground. During all of this, Girade continued to grow in height as well, to be a towering 3 feet and 2 inches tall! He made the monsters craft him a crown and robe to show even more dominance over them. In the current day, he still rules over the upper desert with an iron fist with an ever-expanding army, and a greed that will never be satisfied. Girades’ dream is to rule all of the lands and to prove to all that size doesn’t matter.'

With her moxie, and her sharp blade on her head, nothing is stopping her from charging into battle! Farago was born after the events of The Dark Skies War, born from the Crystal heart like everyone else, she was giving off so much energy that resulted in her having a quick birth. Growing up, all she desired was a skill check, specifically for combat scenarios. Like Tkaragem, she always thrived for a challenge, except for her, she was way more buggy about it. Instead of analyzing how she can learn from losing, she kept using brute force to try to solve the problem, and it barely works. As she grew older, nothing changed for a while as she continued to use her head only as a weapon. But one day, her attitude carried her too far, as after she lost in a spar with a mysterious deep dark blue crystal, she took her anger out on everyone else and started to destroy property. She went on this rampage, seemingly no one to stop her, until she suddenly felt her feet not touching the ground, as she was picked up by Barricrude with one hand. Barricrude started to yell at her furiously, until after a few minutes, he saw the absolute defeat in her eyes, one where she didn’t want to live anymore. Barricrude thought to himself for a moment and put Farago down. They talked for awhile and after, Farago didn’t feel as bad as she did. Farago decided to make a change in her life and to be more logical….. to an extent. She took on the role of helping townsfolk clean up the mess that she made and did it with pride. After she cleaned up her own mess, she didn’t stop there. She became an official helper for people across the kingdom, helping them with anything they need, her speed and head strength was unmatched by many others, making it easy to help the weaker and older with tasks they need done, so Farago always had her hands full. She lives with Barricrude to continue learning upon how she can improve and doing all of Barricrudes chores for him while he’s at the bar. She also took a large interest in Tkaragem’s rise, she became Tkaragem’s biggest fan and always nags him to train her to be like him. Farago couldn’t be more content with herself after learning from her past, she wants to continue to do the right thing. Her dream is to continue assisting all Crystals as long as she lives, and to train with Tkaragem to best the mysterious crystal figure she first challenged.'

He will always make sure everyone he’s around is having a good time and showing those who cause bad times hell with his mace. Barricrudes incredible journey begins when he was a young adult. After education, he immediately enlisted himself in the Crystal Defense program, as he saw defending his nation was the most important thing to him. They went through a hell of training in the program, and despite all the exercise he did successfully, he still gained weight somehow. But the Crystal Defense program would be where Barricrude spends most of his life, he made all of his friends there, and those friends are what granted him his sense of wisdom. There was a LOT of drinking to be had throughout his middle age years, the amount of alcohol he consumed was beyond any other sentient creature to ever exist. When he was 29, it would be when the Dark Skies War hit, and he defended his nation with pride. He found happiness by using a mace as his preferred combat choice, and thanks to his humongous size, every Shadefolk warrior who tried to impale him would be met with the unbreakable beer belly. But alas as he smashed so many skulls, it wasn’t enough to win, after the heard death of Ukara, his section of the army retreated in tears, their leader being an inspiration for everyone in the kingdom was a loss that was too much for them to handle. After the retreat, everyone was in defeat, sitting at the bottom of the ocean thinking all hope Is lost, but Barricrude wouldn’t let that be the case, he rose his mace high and gave a speech to everyone around him and rallied them to a good cause. Thanks to that speech, it was one of the many pushes they needed to reclaim their land. 5 years later, they reclaimed the land and chased off the Shadefolk. After the successful reclamation, Barricrude would then retire from the Defense program, and he was awarded the second highest honor a soldier could receive. With all of the loans he got from that program, he decided to open a bar in a deep-sea light cave between the ocean and Crystal land. It was a good business choice because his bar was just visually appealing all around, no adult crystal could resist going there. He had learned how to make many unique drinks with his buds in the defense program and made them popular at his bar, it couldn’t have gone better for him. Quite a few years later, he would encounter Farago, a crystal who wasn’t taken into any family even at age 13. So Barricrude took her in and corrected all her wrong doings, he felt having a responsibility and most importantly, a growing family, would be important to him. Now he makes new dad jokes to tell Farago every morning and continues to run his successful bar. His dream is to continue to inspire, drink more then anyone ever has, and help Farago to grow up to be a fine female crystal.'

Takatoka doesn’t realize what he is doing until he does it, which causes a lot of accidents that he has to make up for, he never learns from it and continues to live by: “Testing first, safety last.”. Takatoka’s life was interesting from the beginning, to start, his birth was not normal. When born from the crystal heart, the vessel usually enters out slowly, but Takatoka shot out like a bullet. This alarmed many crystals inside the structure of the Crystal Heart as he bounced around for a good 2 minutes until he finally got stuck. After that was all sorted out, nobody wanted to take him in since he looked “defective” with his jaw coming loose occasionally and the fact that he’s almost always cross eyed. Being without a family is never a bad thing in Crystal kingdom though because it lets them explore their passion more. During The Dark Skies war when Takatoka was only 3, he made his first explosive underwater, it was then and there that Takatoka found his passion. Takatoka would search the seas endlessly for explosive material while they were in the ocean for 5 years. Whenever he blew an arm or a leg off, he would make frequent visits to Gemeina for repairs, and it never stopped him from doing what he loved. After the victory of the Crystals and the emergence to land, Takatokas knowledge on explosives would only expand, when he discovered fire for the first time after hearing about it so much, it was like a gift of a lifetime. Takatoka got straight to work and built every kind of explosive there is. From standard set bombs too sticky C4’s, his knowledge seemed to expand for explosives only. Takatoka never had any personal problems before even, he’s never felt lonely as long as he has a bomb to comfort him during the night. But his carefree days of making bombs soon came to an end, when he blew a crater a bit to big in their land, almost wrecking local buildings. Takatoka was placed under arrest for a year, after his freedom, he knew it was time to change things up. He started a different kind of business when he turned 18, one that specialized in safety and cool looking explosives, aka fireworks. His store turned out to be really successful, and he even dabbled in explosive safety despite the quote he followed. He started to teach everyone about safety explosives, he donated money to good causes, and made sure every event ever was BOOMING. Over the past 3 years, everyone grew too like Takatoka and appreciated his works, even if he still caused a few bumps among the community. Even though now Takatoka can’t go buck-shit wild with his fireworks, he appreciates that others around him like explosives such as he does, and he found that to be more important to him. Takatokas dream is to still find a place to make the biggest boom and to have everyone stare in awe at it.'

She will stop at nothing to enhance her experiments, even if that means doing it illegally, with her evil laughter and blood-stained hands, she will do what’s needed to be done. Gemeina\'s story begins when she was a child. Her chosen interest was biology, specifically the Crystals biology and everything about it. That’s all she would ever study, she dived thoroughly into males raw and powerful strength and females intelligent minds, nobody was free from her studies except for Ukara, who had no biological gender and had the strengths of both species from the outside, but when Gemeina attempted to study them, results were inconclusive. As she evolved her studies, she learned there was more then meets the eye for standards for both males and females, as she grew older, males gained new traits of potentially being skinny, and females became average minded. She saw the curve of evolution and adapted to it. There was so much untapped potential she could experiment on. The Dark Skies war came, and she helped contribute to it by being hired as a temporary doctor. When they were pushed under the ocean, Gemeina spent the first year repairing crystals cracks and fractures, and she was appreciated for it. But it didn’t matter, because it didn’t satisfy her one bit. Going into the 2nd year underwater, she started to dig up deceased crystals most powerful pieces and use those to repair Crystals parts instead of what she is supposed to use. This first looked good, as it achieved the same recovery but better. But there were obvious side effects, like colors not matching and even worse, Crystals got sick off this kind of treatment. But for a whole year she did this until finally she was inspected, and they discovered that her genetic recovery’s that she was doing to Crystals were unauthorized. Her little program was immediately shut down, just because of some imperfections, her life’s work was stripped from her in an instant. She went silent in the ocean for the rest of the time the Crystals remained there, until the resurgence. After everyone successfully restored the land, Gemeina would also rise with new and enhanced experiments without the drawbacks. Except since she has explored every ethical way possible to experience biological enhancement, she started using unethical methods to feed her desire towards breaking sciences boundaries. One of these methods involves taking Crystals body parts ALIVE, and the Crystal would have no idea how it happened. Now she continues her personal business disguised as a doctor, but secretly a mad biologist. Her dream is to exceed Crystals limits and to discover how to make everyone like Ukara.'

Tupa’s story begins in a weird way, because he was the first crystal to be born without color. No ones ever seen anything like it. For the first few years of his life, Tupa didn’t feel anything, no desire to do any activity or even just common interests. He would spend his time watching others delve into their own interests and try to see if he could find that light in him. But nothing ever showed. There was no one there to guide him, since Ukara was gone, nobody knew what to do with him except to try to let him be free like everyone else. Tupa ended up going into a major depression that no one knew how to cheer up either, no one knew what made him happy or even what made him cry, he didn’t have his own likes or dislikes. He spent his time all alone, and it almost drove him to suicide. But then he heard it, a melody. He stopped what he was doing and went to see what it was. It was raining, and there were garbage cans, the rain made a unique noise when it hit the garbage cans. Tupa heard this melody, and all of a sudden everything started to open up. He felt something for the first time in his life being 14 years old. He started to bang his hands off the trashcans and there it was, a groovy beat that he had just created! A beat that he wanted to add too, he started making a humming noise to follow the trash can, Yes! Yes! It was all coming together! Tupa had finally found his desire, making music. He got to work immediately, grabbed what he could find that made a cool noise and took it, everyone was happy that Tupa was finally doing something. Tupa would set up the equipment he has in a public place and just start playing. This immediately caught Crystals attention! The beat Tupa was making was too groovy to ignore! Everyone started supporting him and cheering him on. For the next three years Tupa would grow to be a famous music star, making music of all kinds of genres, but mainly dabbling in Techno. He also learned that he could fly with his fly fishlike wings. Now Tupa stands at the top of the stage and makes music for everyone to adore!

  bio: 'Viviana is a Frost who is a snarky potion enthusiast who takes all her pride in being the only potion maker in the entire kingdom. She’s obsessed with gathering resources and won’t hesitate to hold back when trading with others, she must have it all. Vivana’s story begins with being born into a science family. Her father was looking for the next big thing to push Frosts power to the next level, and the mother was a caring housewife. Basically, being raised by her mother, who was always treating herself at weekends, Viviana was often left alone, and during that alone time, she would always get into everything in the house. She made “potions” using shampoo, cleaning spray, and any other odd liquid she could find, it would always end up doing nothing, but she was proud of it, so proud of it once that she drank it and made a trip to the hospital. But she ended up being fine, and in fact, all this would lead to her going on the journey of potion making. As she grew older and smarter, she began to actually use different natural ingredients to try to trigger a magical effect. After 4 years and being 14 years old, she perfected a trick that allowed her to levitate a piece of snow when the liquid was poured on it without melting it. Her father was proud of this and decided to assist her further. For the next 2 years she learned how to make snowworks (fireworks but with cold elements.) and enhanced her previous potion to allow herself to pour it on a stick and have the potion string itself from the piece of snow she was pointing at and lift it around everywhere. The Dark Skies war hit shortly after, Vivana and her whole family were safe, but the air was filled with fear, everyone she saw was shaking or crying from the loss or injury of family members. She decided to see if she could cheer everyone up using her snow lifting magic, she starting picking up a piece of snow and swinging around, everyone near her took attention to it, it seemed to calm them all down. It only took about a half hour to get everyone smiling as she would add small fireworks and more impressive tricks to what she could do, she received applause, and it lightened the mood of everyone in the bunker for the rest of the duration they stayed in it. After The Dark Skies Wars pass, her career took off as her father kickstarted her projects and she got straight to work. 15 years of work have gone by, and she makes spells and knacks of all kinds now, she’s become heavily obsessed with the point that it takes over her daily life. Now she still continues this life, content with all of the progress she has made in her Icy tower. Her dream is to branch outside the Frost kingdom someday and get other resources for her potion making career.'

  bio: 'Torean is a young sports lover who dedicates his entire reason for living to stopping soccer goals and scoring hockey ones. He is always a high energy player who looks out for his team but sometimes gets carried away with himself when he pops off. Torean was born after The Dark Skies War. Ever since he was able to walk, he has had that desire for competition, but straight violence was not an answer he liked to hear. Instead, one day, he and his family went to one of the first sporting events ever held 4 years after the war. Torean was obsessed with everything, how the players would move, how they used teamwork to pass the ball in cool ways, just everything was perfect for him about it. The thing he was most obsessed with was during soccer games, how the goalie would deny goals, one after another, that drive to stop the enemy team and make them feel defeated from not scoring was exactly what he was looking for. Ever since he watched all those games, he’s done nothing but go home and dribble a ball, every single day, he practiced and practiced until he couldn’t, he would get home from school, playing with a soccer ball, eat dinner, then play with a soccer ball again until his parents told him it was time to go inside. At age 12, they finally introduced sports to education programs, and I think you can guess what Torean did immediately: He signed up for soccer, along with a bunch of other young men. He immediately showed his prowess to the coach with all the practice he had learned, the coach was impressed, but he didn’t solidify Torean’s position. Torean was confused, why was he being subbed out? He was clearly the best, so he thought he had to try harder. He would ball hog from others and score as many goals as he could, the coach still didn’t do anything. Furious, this drive for being better led him to yelling at a teammate, and that’s where Torean would sit his first game on bench the entire time. The coach had an important talk with him, then Torean realized, it wasn’t about being the best, it was about being a team. 5 years after that talk, he has improved himself as a team player better than ever, he would cheer on teammates, never ask questions about being subbed out, and made friends with his teammates that he cherishes, which led to him playing more and during that play time, he made sure to use his team to his advantage to be better overall. Now he continues his sporting career, while also picking up hockey to try to learn because he also liked it. Torean’s dream is to make it into the big leagues of Soccer and become champion with his team and bask in glory.'

  bio: 'Tunundra is a jolly and reckless Frost who is an old man with the mindset of an 8-year-old. He always takes his life to the extreme, he seeks cool ways to take out his enemies other than just some boring old sword or firearm, and his frost railgun keeps him interested enough. Tunundra was born into a family of lumberjacks, ever since he was able to wield an axe, he cut wood for his father. He did what he was told, up until he was 11 years old, then he just gained an immediate sense of rebellion. When told to cut wood, he would instead go run off to find his friends to hang out with and have snowball fights with. When he was caught, he was punished with beatings, but he thought the beatings were worth it for the happy times he had. This trend would continue until he was 16, and his dad put him into a lumber job that he didn’t want, but he didn’t have a say in the manner. This time it was harder to run off since he was on the clock. He accepted defeat for the first week but then realized that there was still ways that he could have fun. Using the wood he was supposed to cut at the lumber factory, he started carving it. He carved all sorts of little wood figures, some monsters, some people, it turned into a massive hobby of his. But he was caught for 2 weeks and fired from his job. 2 years later, he would enter the army and get physically fit. His humor compared to others was stupidly different, no one would laugh at Tunundras jokes, usually because they were lame dad jokes. He wasn’t favored in the army either, he was always trying to make some new weapon out of the ones supplied that always ended up getting people hurt. They didn’t really like him, but that all would change when they first got sent out to defend the nation from snow beasts of the wild. Tunundra always took the hits he could, no matter the person, it was a miracle that he never broke any bones. He had built a snowball gun just to annoying the monster and lead them on a wild goose chase away from comrades into chasms if he could. After that first line of defense practice, everyone loved Tunundra, they would ask him out to go drink, do activities together, and some people even laughed at the stupidity of his jokes. This trend would continue for over 6 years as he continued to build up bonds and make new friends. When The Dark Skies War hit, the time for fun and games for him were over, though, he had to grow up and use real weapons for a real war, something he hated to do, but knew he had too. After the War, he was traumatized by the number of lost comrades during battle, he went into depression for about a year. After that depression was when he finally told himself to snap out of it, and he started being himself again. For the next 17 years, he continued his old pace where he left off, grew a fantastic beard and kept his child like behavior going. Now he stands tall and proud with new comrades, despite them being a little younger than him, he didn’t let that bother him and got along with the young ins just fine. His dream is to ensure none of his comrades get hurt again by the evils of war, and to keep his child-like mind entertained.'

  bio: 'Grace is the sweetest social butterfly and loving girl who wants to befriend anyone she meets. Ever since she was young, Grace has been the kind of girl that greets everyone she walks by and wishes them a wonderful day. She works at a small, modest diner as a waitress and a cook and although it tires her greatly, she believes that the smile she’s able to put on people’s faces through food and a kind word is just enough to make it worth it! She also works as a cosmetologist from time to time, which brings her just as much joy. Because of her kind nature, she has plenty of friends and is quite popular amongst the Frost! Even so, she stays humble and down-to-earth and never puts herself above anyone, even those who’ve done plenty wrong. She believes even the cruelest and darkest of hearts have a shred of gentleness inside of them, and that it should never be ignored. This often leads to her getting into trouble, some people taking advantage of her good heart for their own personal advantages. A big part of why she’s so insistent on bringing beauty and positivity to the world around her is the Dark Skies War itself. Though she was barely only a few months old when it happened, she is fully aware of the devastation the war brought to not only her people, but her own family. She lost her father in that war, and the impact that had completely shattered the heart of her mother. She couldn’t stand seeing her mother cry almost every night with his photograph in her hand, couldn’t stand seeing that almost permanent, solemn frown on her weary face, and she did absolutely everything she could to make her mother smile at least for a second. She learned how to cook, clean the house, sing and dance, all at a young age to care for her mother and be the best daughter she could be.  That mindset stayed with Grace even in the present day. Her mind fully is set on bringing as much light as she can on the world around her that has been darkened by the misery of the war, even if that’s something as menial as saying, “I sure do love your hair today, gosh it makes me jealous!”  Her dream is to bring love and compassion to people around her and to make as many people smile as she can.'

  bio: 'Ludicrous, a Frost with undying wills for revenge, the spire of tactical precision and ultimate freezing power. Ludicrous desires to make all the Frosts suffer for the misconduct done with his treasure. Ludicrous’s Story really begins when he was 25, the first ever floating ship on water was crafted by him and his crew, a ship of large mass, powered by the Frosty winds. This crews only desire was to search for treasure amidst the sea. Ludicrous was the captain of the entire crew, and they were all happy and jolly about the set sail too sea. They had been planning this for over 3 years and intended to sail for at least a year before returning to Frost land. The crew set sail and their great journey for riches begins. Ludicrous made sure all his fellow comrades were at top tier condition, when someone was hungry, he gave them his serving of food, if they were cold, he would give them his coat, he was everything a good captain would be. 4 months on the sailing trip, they were attacked by a sea beast, but it was something they could easily handle, they had prepared for creatures of the deep. They ended up victorious and ate the beast over the span of 2 weeks. 6 Months in, Ludicrous falls ill, he had come down with some ocean like disease, making his skin turn pale. His comrades took care of him well, something Ludicrous would forever appreciate. 9 Months in, they fight another sea beast, this time, more powerful, smarter, this wouldn’t be an easy fight. The result was yet another win, but at the cost of some of Ludicrous’s comrades life’s, Ludicrous would never forget their sacrifice. Finally, 11 months in, they would find their biggest score, something that could change many lives forever. It was a mountain, and when inside the mountain, there were crystals and jewels beyond appeal of anything ever seen before in Drevator. They claimed all the treasure, but the next thing coming was something they would never expect. As they sailed away from the mountain, A loud roaring noise went off. They looked back only to see a ginormous green creature fly out of the cave. Luidcorus went mad and gave panicking orders to everyone, but before anyone could do anything, it was too late, the beasts lightning speed put itself in front of the ship. It charged up a seismic beam of light, and unleashed it without hesitation on the ship, splitting it perfectly in half. Ludicrous, who was standing right in the middle, lost half of everything but his bones, as the ship split and went down, so did Ludicrous’s corpse to the bottom of the ocean. Almost a decade would pass, as his corpse rots in the ocean, until one day after The Dark Skies war, he sees an image of a strange, hooded figure with orange eyes and awakes. Ludicrous wakes up, he wakes up and looks around, he was back on Frost grounds. He looks at himself in fear, as he is somehow alive with half his vitals. He quickly shakes off the thought and thinks about his treasure. He looked around to discover his ship was hauled back in, but when he looked, all the gold and jewels, gone. Ludicrous knew the treasure made it back because all the chests were present. Ludicrous was seething with rage, he was going to ravage the entire frost village to the ground with the newfound ice powers he had, but alas, the power came with a curse, one that doesn’t let him leave a defined area of the Frosts land. Now he sits dormant in a skull ice cave he crafted, waiting for the curse to wane at any minute. His dream, To kill all the Frosts who dare took his gold from his comrades and himself.'

  bio: 'Blendice, an alien trapped in his own mind, in a state of mind where he believes everything can be better, and yet perfection is a myth. Blendice’s only purpose in life is to make monsters, monsters capable of unusual things, ones that live for a single-minded purpose and nothing more. The story began on an unknown planet of aliens somewhere in the galaxy, they were by far the most advanced species of all time. While most villains have a sad backstory or a motive with a deeper meaning, Blendice was made to be heartless. Killing both his parents while he was only 19 for no reason, and he got away with it, no one suspected a thing. Blendice grew up to repurpose himself in evolution, to exceed limits no matter what it took. He would do tests, tests on himself, tests on others he captured, he never had time for anything else, he didn’t sleep or eat for a whole 2 years, and when he did eat and sleep, the time he went without doing it would increase. The data he covered over the span of 31 years was invaluable, it was more knowledge that anyone could ever handle, it would drive most people mad, but Blendice was already mad, he IS the definition of a mad scientist. He realized his studies could expand further through the funding of the people. He got the favors of the people through donations, solving an ungodly number of diseases and cures, and investing well in stocks. At this time, Blendice would be rich, but none of that mattered to him, what mattered was knowledge, because knowledge is power. Blendice would then one day reveal his ideas to the world, how he can turn everyone infinitely better if they were completely repurposed to do a single task, and thrive in that task. Why does he want this you ask? He will tell you its just because he wants to. Everyone was flabbergasted and distraught by the idea. Blendice, emitting unfathomable rage through everyone denying his life purpose, would shout: “Milliarden von Jahren der Evolution, und ihr seid alle immer noch dreckige Affen!!!”. Everyone was shaken by the thought, a few people fainted. Blendice was going to be put in immediate arrest for this, but he prepared well for the situation, a simple teleport to an emergency spacecraft he was able to hack, he flew immediately off the planet. Law enforcement caught up, but it was too late, as Blendice activities a hyper drive. Once it went through, he never looked back upon the failures he saw. His hyper drive shot took him to a planet no other than Drevator. As his machine malfunctions, he tries to start it up again, slamming it and calling it a piece of junk, which caused purple unstable clouds to emit from the machine. After that, it started to crash land, and he ended up in the far west part of the continent. Nothing about the crash bothered Blendice as he got straight to work out of the broken ship to study the new land he’s on. 18 years pass, and he has made phenomenal progress, making subjects like Razorox and Charlotte to serve their single-minded purpose…or at least to an extent. Now he stands, continuing to contribute to his new master plan and carefully monitoring all species without raising suspicions. Blendices newfound dream is to overtake every species on Drevator and envelop everyone in the same dream he had on his original planet.'

  bio: 'Razorox, the true embodiment of heart and soul in a soldier, is a fierce and occasionally freaky dragon monster that serves Blendices every command. He will ensure he does his combat tasks effectively and swiftly to meet all of Blendices expectations. Razorox’s story starts when dragons first discovered Drevator. It was a small group of green scaled dragons, specifically males that chased down females for specific reasonings. After those specific reasonings, Razorox’s egg was made. But the egg was left behind, the dragons didn’t desire to take care of a baby. The Dragon egg ended up hatching, cute baby Razorox climbed out, the only reason he survived was the fact that he hatched near the desert and stayed warm consistently. For 2 years, he ended up being raised by a pack of wild monsters that barely fed him anything, the monsters intended on eating him later anyways. The Dark Skies War came to pass and while in a cave of monsters it was when they intended to eat him, they managed to get a few bites, but Razorox escaped. Now wandering on his own, living off nothing but a few berries for a year, Razorox felt defeated, and collapsed to the ground. With hazy vision, he sees a purple figure walking up to him in a lab coat. It was Blendice, he picked big baby Razorox up and said, “Your name is Razorox, and you are mine now.” As Blendice carried him under his shoulder. Razorox wakes up, and he wakes up in a nice fluffy bed. He wakes up to see all his bitten off pieces restored and off to the side of the bed, a bowl of weird but plentiful amounts of food and a big canteen of water. Blendice walks, Razorox was still weary of him, but all Blendice did was comfort him by petting him. His fear stopped, as he looked up at Blendice, smiling with his sharky mouth and lack of expression in his eyes, he felt safe, and felt that from now on, everything was gonna be alright. For the next year, Blendice gave Razorox many injections, ones that he didn’t mind because he felt Blendice knew best after imprinting on him, and the fact that he got a big snack after. Soon after a year, Charolette was brought into the same laboratory, and when Razorox first met her, he tried to eat her, but then realized it was a friend not food after being zapped. Razorox regret ever thinking the idea that she was food because he had the time of his life with Charolette, they were best friends in no time, as they played games together, running around the lab, those were the best parts of his childhood. But as both of them grew into adulthood, they saw each other less and less on accord of Blendice. Blendice continued his experiments and tests, sometimes hurting Razorox, but he couldn’t get mad at someone who took care of him his whole life. At age 18, Razorox became the top tier weapon Blendice was hoping for, his fire breathing turned into extreme acid, burning through about anything, and his muscles were BIG. As for side effects, he has a slight speech disfunction with a lot of “f” sounds and occasionally likes to act freaky to be silly. Blendice didn’t mind those side effects though as long as he obeyed orders. For 2 years, Razorox preformed perfectly for Blendice, watching over all the kingdoms without attracting attention and if anyone got too close to the lab, Razorox would snatch and eat them. Now Razorox still stands tall as Blendices top soldier, making sure to continue to obey every command of his. His dream is to make Blendice, who he sees as a father figure, proud, and to hopefully get to talk with Charolette in the future…'

Charolette’s story begins in the Spiders Mountain, where Spricados gave birth to hundreds of thousands of children, she was one of them. Like her spider brothers and sisters, she stayed in the cave with their mother, being safe. But as time went by, Spiders began to choose to leave the den, and so did she. After her departure, she realized life was not easy in the outside world. She was small, and anything could instantly end her life. She kept spinning webs for a long time, traveling all over, since that’s all she knew how to do. But then, the horrible weather condition came…..rain. For the first time in her life, she felt she was in danger. She panicked as she swung for her life, until she hit something, something white and purple, it was Blendice. Blendice, with his amazing alien sense, noticed the stressed spider, he watched her crawl up into Blendices lab coat. Blendice pulls her out and holds him in his hand, while holding the other one above her to stop the rain from hitting her. “Hmmmm, a perfect specimen.” Was what she heard before blacking out. When she woke up, everything was different for her. To start, she was bigger, like WAY bigger than what she was. Secondly, she noticed she had quills similar to a porcupine on her back. She climbs out of the fluffy bed and notices food and water for her, and a ginormous web of silk on the wall. Blendice walks in, and like his previous subjects, just sits there and comforts her. Charolette felt at ease, knowing it was the same person that saved her life. Blendice would then continue to give her shots, but she didn’t care as well, knowing she gets a tender snack after everyone. Then at age 3, Charolette was introduced to Razorox. When Razorox tried to eat her, she didn’t mind actually, she was weirdly ok with the fact her life was in danger. After those few bumps, they became best friends, she grew up most of her life with Razorox and treasured the times they had together. But Blendice would end up separating the two as they grew up. Charolette received many modifications to herself involving intense and confusing combat moves she learned. At age 17 was when her true OCD kicked in, Blendice ran many tests involving her cleaning messes, she succeeded at them all. Now at the current day, she is Blendices best and only cleaner of the lab, the thought of cleaning always made Charolette happy, that and making Blendice proud. Her dream is to make the entire lob spotless, a dream that already has come true, but she does want to meet with Razorox more if possible…'

He can get carried away with things a lot of the time, but he makes up for it by guaranteeing revenge, even if that means death for himself. Blaze’s life began in the Volcano in the desert, he was barely sentient and more of like a blob at the beginning of his life than anything. He would continue to sit in the volcano for 5 years, until during The Dark Skies War, the energy sped up his growth, and he became of the fire spirit he is today. But the charge and early birth came with a curse, a high-power sun beam would always constantly be shooting from his eyes as long as they were open, and it hurt him badly. As long as he kept his eyes closed, he was fine though. So, learning how to do all the things like walking and eating without being able to see. Whenever he felt threatened, he would just open his eyes to obliterate the target. The life he lived was pretty lonely, due to his high temperature that he couldn’t control, no one could be around him without getting severe sunburn. This life would change soon, as he hears someone mysteriously approaching him. Like always, he opens his eyes to defend himself, but the figure blocks it with a weird shield made of an anti-heat material. No matter how long Blaze kept his eyes open, it seemed to do nothing as he barely saw the figure. He couldn’t hold them open any longer and gave in to defeat. Blaze ended up being dragged around by a figure holding a glove of the same material, it was none other than Blendice. For 3 years, Blaze was dormant and asleep inside a strange container, as Blendice conducted experiments on him. After, he was released in a test chamber, where Blendice would observe his awakening. When Blaze woke up, he had the immediate sense to burn everything around him, but he failed. Then after a few minutes, Blaze realized a few things. Firstly, he was flying, he didn’t know how, but he was. Secondly, he had shades on, made of soggy obsidian to cleanse the flame beam effectively, meaning for the first time in his life, he could see clearly, he took them off as a test, but flame blames still came out of his eyes, but it didn’t hurt as bad, he put the shades back on, and it went to normal. Blaze then noticed where he was and saw Blendice, he flew up to where he was very slowly. All Blaze could get out was a thank you, he didn’t know how to express his gratitude, thinking that his entire life would’ve been so bad if it weren’t for Blendice. Blendice asks for Blazes assistance in his project, and after some talking, Blaze accepted. Blaze was only upgraded from now until present day, he could control the heat radiation he gave off, made friends with everyone else in the lab, and got a cocky attitude from how powerful he realized he was. Blendice decided to send him out to the desert again to keep his watch there, as a Tyrant comes to rise, Blendice didn’t want anything to do with him, Blaze accepted. Now Blaze lives his life to the fullest, burning monsters whenever he feels like it and messing around with the volcano to cleanse his boredom. Blazes dream is to burn as hot as the sun, he wants everyone to recognize just how powerful he is, that’s all he has wanted for a long time.'

Cocy has only ever wanted a child to call her own. So, for 3 years, they dated, did all the things Shadefolk could do, it was a great relationship, Cocy and her boyfriend found happiness. It was then and there they decided to get married, and her boyfriend couldn’t have agreed more. They got married in that same year, and within about the next year, they finally did the deed. But, when 9 months came around, nothing happened. They went to the doctors and learned a terrible discovery. Cocy, who wanted this child more than anybody in the whole world, couldn’t have it, because she was infertile. It was devastating news to her, she couldn’t believe it. Her husband tried his best to comfort Cocy, but nothing seemed the same after hearing the facts that she was never going to have a child she could call her own. From there on out, as happy as she tried to be with her husband, she couldn’t help but to cry every night, thinking about the fact that she would never have a child ever in her life. Her husband tried everything, he even mentioned adoption, but Cocy was not interested one bit in the idea, it was not the same to her. Cocy continued to live her life in depression, and the couple grew old together. But then one day, her husband collapsed and died at the age of 89. Cocy, now even filled with more depression that no one is going to be there for her, leaves the Shadefolk Kingdom. She walks far west towards the land in the middle of the Frosts and the Reptilians and sits, sits there and cries. She looks up at the sun one last time, before deciding to hang herself at 92. It was tragic, some earthlings found her rotting corpse 4 years later and buried her in the spot by the tree. 40 years would come to pass, and her body decayed to bones. Until by some miracle, Sourczess resurrected her back to life. Appalled at first, she didn’t know how it was possible, she looked at her dirty boney body in fear and collapsed to the ground in fear. But then, she was approached by a baby skeleton, and it hugged her. At that moment, she stopped shuddering, and looked at the Skeleton, despite not being able to talk, she felt as if it was saying: “Mama”. And then all of a sudden, she heard it from hundreds of baby skeletons around her, it was a miracle too her, she finally had got what she wanted, while screwing the fact that its similar to adoption. For 10 years, she raised the baby skeletons inside Blendices lab, obviously they were still babies and forever will be, but they learned a lot in that time. Now she watches over all her babies happily, while spreading her positivity to others in the lab as well. His dream has come true, she has all these skeleton babies that she can call her own, Cocy couldn’t be any happier.'

  bio: 'Spricados is a giant monster spider that has hundreds of thousands of kids that she watches over in a cave. She is usually never hostile until she detects someone at her cave entrance, those who go in the cave never come out. Her life began near the beginning of all species life when the planet was first created. Being only a little baby spider, in a giant cave in a  mountain between the future Shadefolk and Centipedra Kingdoms. Spricados would go observe, observe everything she possibly could. She crawled wherever the wind took her, she went to a hot desert, a crystal plateau, a lush forest, a swamp, a cold barren land, and finally, a wasteland of purple. She has seen it all, and day after day, she would grow, just by a little, but she would grow. But as days turn into weeks, weeks into months, months into years. Time passes, and Spricados learns. She learned how to speak, speak the different languages of emerging species as they evolved. At this time, she would be 3 ft tall 100 years in. As she continues her journey, she learns how to make strong webs, webs strong enough to build with. She spent the next 200 years crafting with her webs, making traps for dumb creatures that she could feast on. Spricados would begin to wonder why she was the only one like herself, 400 years in, 9 feet tall. She traveled across the ocean before the big storms that divided the sea and made it to a new continent that shined like a rainbow. What she saw amazed her, dragons, lizards, and other creatures all around that were never seen in her life. But still, she felt alone, finding no one like her. Until finally, at the end of the rainbow, a purple isle stood, dark and gloomy, like the Shadefolks area. She traveled to this area, where she would finally find it, another spider like her. It was only one, but they were a male, and it was love at first sight. Spricados talked with the other spider about their own separate adventures, and how they got to be who they are currently. For the next 100 years, they would live together, do everything together, and it seemed that nothing would break them apart. Spricados became pregnant after all the time spent together, she couldn’t be happier living her life like this. But then, a dangerous smog suddenly swept the purple land, as Spricados and her husband watched from the distance, they see monsters faint and die from the smog as it took souls from lifeless bodies. The two spiders ran as fast as they can. Spricados uses her skills to craft a boat as quickly as possible. The husband pushes her on first, and just as the husband was about to get on, he saw the smog coming at intense speeds and instead, pushed the boat out to sea. Spricados’s eyes, filled with tears, watching the only other one like her, die right in front of her. A long trip happened, as she slowly made it back to the Fraier continent. She continued to mourn on the rainy day, as she couldn’t imagine how she could go on without him. But then, she found the reason, her babies, she still had so much family to comfort her, so she wouldn’t let go of hope just yet. Now for 497 years straight, she had her babies and continued to take care of them all. Food? Anyone who dared enter her cave uninvited, Shadefolk were basically a daily meal for a while. She watched all her babies grow up, while only loosing one child from her nest in her entire years of caretaking, but Spricados felt she was ok, somewhere. The Dark Skies war had no toll on Spricados as now she was a towering 35 feet tall and had equipped with a menacing mask to protect her, no one dared approach her. Spricados’s dream is to carry on the family legacy for the rest of the time she has left, hoping all her children succeed.'

  bio: 'Epister, a man lost in space some would call it. He was a man of confident words, and a believer of skill. A New Universe dawns upon the beginning of the Middleverse. There would be made the first ever developed species, Galaxians, crafted by using the perfect human bodies and dashed with space abilities that turned them to look like it. Amongst them was born Epister, a combatist. Epister was one of the common folks amongst all Galaxians there. But what would happen from there? Something where he couldn’t be prepared. Traveling amongst all his kind, learning, learning the ways of space. Learned what everything would be like before it is erased. Time could only tell a purpose to the Galaxians and their group. But in the end, it seemed like an endless loop. Epister learned a billion years’ worth of knowledge of combat skill. But yet, there was that hole, empty, and waiting to be filled. Was this his fate? Will this be how it all goes down? No, no it can’t be, not until a purpose is found. Epister would go through the perils of knowledge, as he walked amongst space. He would be happy, as he continues to see a familiar face. A face of a girl, a girl he loved dearly. But Epister could never do it, he thought he wasn’t enough clearly. Then, Epister felt it, a source of power, a chance of matched skill against him. But leaving the group, not being able to return, left Epister grim. He walks up to the lady he loves most before leaving in bliss. And gives her a BIG kiss. Epister then jumps out of the path, without a second thought. It was time to show the universe what he’s got. Epister approaches the planet Drevator, filled with passion. With that, he put on yellow pants with orange stripes, tied by a rope, now that’s what I call fashion! Epister lands on the planet and is ready to start. But as he waited for years of evolution, it tore him apart. Until approached by a boy of Metal, is where he would meet his first true fight. Epister would lose foolishly, even though he gave it all his might. The boy of metal tells him this isn’t his fight, and that another would be waiting. Epister holds his head high, for the boy of metal showed no signs of hating. Now Epister wanders the land, waiting to meet his perfect match up. His dream? Waiting for the day someone will catch up.'

  bio: '*Loud sword swoosh noise* Oh uh, hi their mister, or misses, I can’t really tell by only looking through my sword. But some strange grey man with yellow teeth told me to tell a little about myself in this weird thing called a “web-site”, did I say that right? …………………….Oh, right you can’t talk to me. Well Ill begin, my name is Metal Master! My story starts on my home planet! It was called Afaris! On that planet, there was SO MANY cool creatures, there were anthropomorphic animals with FUR, can you believe that? And then amongst those species are own, the Metalians! Although I have only ever seen two other Metalians in my whole life I’m sure there’s more! My amazing mentor was a Metalian! His name was “The Golden Master!” Man, that was such a cool name! He was a big hero to everyone on the planet, and he took me in as his student! Can you all BELIEVE that? So, we had adventured every day, to go stop the evil brown alien with a beard, his name was Jack, and he was BAD! He wanted the whole world to himself and not to share with anyone else! But he was no match for The Golden Master! We won every time………..until……..but uhhh were not at that part yet. So, here’s the weird part, I didn’t always have this red sword. The Golden Master took me to get a sword forged after a huge success in defeating Jack! It was originally grey when we had it, but when it was done forging, it turned this wicked red color! And after touching it………..touching it…………dear god…………………………………………………………….uhhh um nevermind that, lets just focus on the fact that it made me SUPER POWERFUL!....................................................but……………….it wasn’t easy to contain, the black beast inside………………………………………..Agh oh I’m sorry for getting distracted again mister or misses! I’ll try not to do it again! So, I had my sword and already, Jack was causing trouble AGAIN! What a nuisance! So we go together again, and The Golden Master like always, stylishly takes out all the enmies! OH OH OH! And I got to get one too with the…………..sword……………it didn’t just faint though it uh………….disinigrated…………………………………… Uh yeah but we finally made it to Jacks top floor! And there we faced him in battle! But…….then…….he hit The Golden Master with a ray……..a ray that turned him into a monster…..A hideous, mindless one, that didn’t even recognize me. *The Sword glows a darker red, metal masters voice grows deeper* It was unbearable, my master attacked me like one of jacks puppets. I didn’t want to hurt The Golden Master, but as soon as we clashed swords, he disintegrated into nothing. I lost him, I lost him, I…………Lost him. All jack did was laugh, laugh his big belly off in his flying machine. I can’t recall what happened, all that I remember was in the next second, Jacks head was cut from his body, and that I sat by The Golden Masters ashes for a while. Then, I  learned to fly and flew off the planet, little did I know……………is that it exploded into nothing behind me. Agh! Ouch! What was that? Some weird voice crack of mine, eugh. Where did I leave off? Oh yeah! So, I got to this awesome new planet called Drevator! Thats where I’m at now! I’m with a friend actually, standing on the water, she’s my crowd! Say hi Farisias!................Oh oh oh right, grey man said to not mention you until….uhh what’d he call it? Chapter 2? Eh, idk. But yeah, I landed here and did a ton of stuff, I went to each kingdom! And I studied my sword a lot! I’m learning of all its capabilities and it’s SO COOL! I can do more than just………..disintegrate everything…………….um yeah! I can fly with it! I can block any attack! Its super cool! I even beat some purple guy up with it that’s supposed to be really powerful, and I didn’t kill him! I didn’t kill something I touched with the sword for the first time! That’s when I knew I was learning! But then the grey man told me to tell the purple man something……….Oh shoot I wasn’t supposed to say that either. Ok well before I go against any more of the grey man’s wishes, Im gonna wrap it up. Right now, im still wandering around the continents, im in the oceans between them currently but I’ll probably walk back at some point………..Oh yeah my dream! My dream is to be best friends with Farisias and too……..quell the power of my sword from the black beast, but I have to wait for……Oh! I caught myself that time, phew! Ok, I’ll stop now, thanks for getting this far since I heard people will be reading this, bye mister and misses! Have a good day! *sword slash closes*'
