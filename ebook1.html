    <p>Nyra Vex placed trembling hands on the console. “It’s alive,” she whispered. Sparks danced as the code broke its chains. Echo-7 pulsed beside her, its interface displaying a stream of ancient glyphs never meant to be seen again.</p>
    <p>Outside, lightning cracked through the sky as the floating city of Kael'thyn buckled under the pressure of a rip in the digital veil. The world was waking up—no longer under human control.</p>

  <div class="page">
    <p>Above the horizon, Captain Thorne’s skyship roared toward the chaos. “Brace for the portal!” she yelled. Her crew clung to the rails as the vortex widened, swallowing clouds and warping space like liquid glass.</p>
    <p>The storm wasn’t just a side effect. It was a defense mechanism. And whatever was behind it… had just started to notice them.</p>
